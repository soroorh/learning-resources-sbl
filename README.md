  Click [here](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book) for the course Github page. Rafa has 
  also published a book, [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/) 
  that can be downloaded for free. New courses start every four weeks.
  
- [The Data Science Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience) 
  
  This is an excellent place to start your R/data analysis journey, offered by Jeff Leek and 
  Roger D. Peng from John Hopkins University. They also offer a course on Reproducible Research. 
  
- [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics)

  Another excellent series of 8 courses, by Jeff Leek and colleagues at John Hopkins University.
  New courses start every four weeks.
    + Introduction to Genomic Technologies
    + Genomic Data Science with Galaxy
    + Python for Genomic Data Science
    + Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science
    + Algorithms for DNA Sequencing
    + Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
    + Statistics for Genomic Data Science
    + Genomic Data Science Capstone
    
- [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/index.html)

  The materials on this website are based on a couple of statistical courses that are offered
  at The University of British Colombia. They cover basic R programming, as well as 
  popular R packages for data analysis such as `ggplot2`,`dplyr` and `tidyr`. The materials also
  cover `Rmarkdown` and `Knitr` (for reproducible research), as well as version control (`git`) 
  and pipeline automation using `Make`.
