# A non-comprehensive list of genomic data science learning resources

Here is a list of online courses on data analysis for genomics. All the following courses can be taken for free. However, you can also pay for a course, if you wish to earn a certificate. 

## All the R thing!
-----
- [Data Analysis for life sciences - Harvadx](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/classes.html)
  
  A series of 7 online courses offered on edx.org by Harvard professor, Rafael Irizarry and his lab members.
    + Statistics and R for the Life Sciences
    + Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra
    + Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments
    + High-Dimensional Data Analysis
    + Introduction to Bioconductor: Annotation and Analysis of Genomes and Genomic Assays
    + High-performance Computing for Reproducible Genomics
    + Case Studies in Functional Genomics
    
  Click [here](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book) for the course Github page. Rafa has 
  also published a book for these series, [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/) 
  that can be downloaded for free. 
  
- [Data Science Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience) 
  
  This is an excellent place to start your R/data analysis journey, offered by Jeff Leek and 
  Roger D. Peng from John Hopkins University. They also offer a course on Reproducible Research.
  New courses start every four weeks. 
  
  **My recommendations:** Start with *R Programming*, *Reproducible Research* and *Data Science Tool Box*(Data Science Specilization),
  if you are a R newbie. Try to do as much as Rafa courses as you can at the same time.
  
- [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics)

  Another excellent series of 8 courses, by Jeff Leek and colleagues at John Hopkins University.
  New courses start every four weeks.
    + Introduction to Genomic Technologies
    + Genomic Data Science with Galaxy
    + Python for Genomic Data Science
    + Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science
    + Algorithms for DNA Sequencing
    + Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
    + Statistics for Genomic Data Science
    + Genomic Data Science Capstone
    
  **My Recommendations:** Try *Python for Genomic Data Science* if you're new to Python and wish to learn it. Their *Statistics for Genomic Data Science* is also an excellent course on statistical genomics.
    
- [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/index.html)

  The materials on this website are based on a couple of statistical courses that are offered
  at The University of British Columbia. They cover basic R programming, as well as 
  popular R packages for data analysis such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `tidyr`. The materials also
  cover `Rmarkdown` and `Knitr` (for reproducible research), as well as version control ( `git` ) 
  and pipeline automation using `Make`.
  
  **My recommendations:** The materials are taught in a very simple language. The instructions
   are easy to follow, and every topic in explained in details. There are hands-on activities as well, if you wish
   to practice the new skills that you learn.
